# Groovy NullPointerException in String Methods with Empty Strings

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue in Groovy related to null handling and string methods.  The provided `myMethod` attempts to handle null inputs gracefully. However, due to how Groovy treats empty strings and nulls, it can still result in unexpected behavior (or a NullPointerException if the `toUpperCase()` method is called on the empty string without a null check).  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive null checks in Groovy, especially when dealing with potentially empty strings.

## Problem

The `myMethod` function intends to handle null inputs and return "null", and handle empty strings by returning an empty string. However, Groovy's loose typing and the implicit behavior of `toUpperCase()` on an empty string might lead to unexpected outcomes depending on whether an empty string is treated as essentially null in your logic.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to thoroughly check for both null and empty string inputs using Groovy's `isEmpty()` method, ensuring that the function behaves predictably in all cases.
